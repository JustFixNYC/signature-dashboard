          The Signature Bank portfolio has always been an important one for

          state of NYC rental housing. This is even more true given{" "}

        <p>
          Before its collapse in March 2023, Signature Bank was one of the most
          significant lenders to multifamily rental housing in New York City,
          with a portfolio of close to 3,000 properties, almost 80% of which
          were likely to contain rent-stabilized units.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the Bank's closure, the portfolio was placed into
          receivership and held by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
          (FDIC) until early 2024, when the loans on rent-regulated housing were
          transferred into two joint ventures, administered by Community
          Preservation Corporation (CPC) and Santander Bank.
        </p>

        <p>
          The FDIC has tasked these joint ventures to undertake an ambitious
          post-disposition program, requiring that CPC and Santander not only
          service and manage the loans, but also ensure that tenant stability,
          building safety, and responsible operations & ownership are
          prioritized, in accordance with the FDICâ€™s statutory requirements
          outlined in the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991.

          Landlord portfolios are identified by cross referencing HPD
          Registration and ACRIS data; they are our best approximations based on
          the publicly available data. To provide input that can help us refine
